Cybertron is a project that helps you practice your Functional JavaScript.
Currently, there are 7 levels, and 4 exercises on each level. Try to complete
all 6 levels, then do it again! Get as many reps as you can and these commands
will become more familiar.

Want more levels? Lets add them!

## How it works?

* Requirements Node v8 (https://nodejs.org)

- Clone Repo -

`git clone https://github.com/twilson63/cybertron.git`

* Install dependencies and Start Server

```sh
cd cybertron
npm install
npm start
```

> Windows Users install browser-sync globally
> `npm install browser-sync -g`

* Use your favorite editor to open the project

You will see 7 js files, called levelx.js and an index.js file.

Open level1.js and start working on the exercises, each time you complete an
exercise go to your browser and refresh the window to see the results.

When you finish the first level to go to the next level, simply uncomment the
level run code in the index.js file and then open the level js file and start
running that level.

## Linter Support

This project supports the `standard` js linter and `prettier`, installing both
projects in your editor will help find typos and bugs. In atom, install the
`linter` and `linter-eslint` packages.
